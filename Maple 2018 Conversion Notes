Maple 2018 Conversion Notes
===========================

Working on grF_createSymFn

Using 2017 as a template:

grF_createSymFn(0,{},{}):
proc (objectName, root, calcFn) local gr_data; if grG_calc and assigned(calcFn) then gr_data[root, grG_metricName, grG_operands] := calcFn(objectName, []) end if; grF_symCore(objectName, [], root); RETURN() end proc

Want Maple 2018 to produce the same thing:


Friday Sept 21:
- Rupup calcFnParams are wrong (fixed)

Tues Sept 25
- display og G(dn,up,cdn) is not happening. Components are non-zero when do a grdata([Gdnupcdn_])

symmetry routines confuse me. Inside some loops there is a calcFn call in others a symCore call. Why?
- it is what does e.g. simplification if there is no need to calculate 
- also does grF_component, so clears is zero flag for display
- if set grOptionVerbose, should see some stuff
- yep, not actually calling grF_symCore
**BUG**
- tried using grtensor:-grF_symCore
- tried exporting grF_symCore
- could look at providing it as an argument, since calcFn seems to work ok...
- other inert functions seem to do ok...

Test Plan
=========
Unit tests for symmetric and asymmetric symmetry creation
Check some standard objects:
- definition of Chr1
- definition of Rabcd
- contraction to Ricci and Gab
- specify components of a vector
