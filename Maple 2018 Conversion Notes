Maple 2018 Conversion Notes
===========================

Working on grF_createSymFn

Using 2017 as a template:

grF_createSymFn(0,{},{}):
proc (objectName, root, calcFn) local gr_data; if grG_calc and assigned(calcFn) then gr_data[root, grG_metricName, grG_operands] := calcFn(objectName, []) end if; grF_symCore(objectName, [], root); RETURN() end proc

Want Maple 2018 to produce the same thing:


Friday Sept 21:
- Rupup calcFnParams are wrong (fixed)

Tues Sept 25
- display og G(dn,up,cdn) is not happening. Components are non-zero when do a grdata([Gdnupcdn_])

symmetry routines confuse me. Inside some loops there is a calcFn call in others a symCore call. Why?
- it is what does e.g. simplification if there is no need to calculate 
- also does grF_component, so clears is zero flag for display
- if set grOptionVerbose, should see some stuff
- yep, not actually calling grF_symCore
**BUG**
- tried using grtensor:-grF_symCore
- tried exporting grF_symCore
- could look at providing it as an argument, since calcFn seems to work ok...
- other inert functions seem to do ok...

Issue with overview. The RN section does something to screw up the calculation of Kerr killing. Get kt(dn,dn,dn) with unassigned gr_data. 
- when trim the RN calc this does not happen
- need to look at the defintion and see if the issue is with construction?
- may be some variable previously unassigned that causes issues when run through subsequent grdefs...
Yep: gr_data[root, reisnord, grG_operands, a1_, a2_, a3_] := calcFn(objectName, [a1_, a2_, a3_])
The previous metric reisnord is being used in the defintion, not grG_metricName. 
- either need to unassign it, or delay it's eval.
FIX: unassign grG_metricName at the start
TODO: Need to check every other inert case to make sure this issue cannot occur. 

List of places that use FromInert():
	contract.mpl
	create.mpl
	grdef.mpl
	parse.mpl

Use grF_unassignMetricNames()/grF_restoreMetrics()

=============
Bug in symmetry routines. LSH is missing indices:
	gr_data[root, grG_metricName, grG_operands] := gr_data[root, grG_metricName, grG_operands, a1_, a2_, a3_, a4_]
typo in sym create. FIXED

KN RiemSq is in a different form - although guessing it is equivilent. Odd that the form is different by might be Maple2018 vs 2017?
- need to prove they are equivilent

Maple 2017: Getting:
grcalc(RiemSq);
Error, (in grtensor:-grF_build_contractFn) incorrect number of arguments to _Inert_FORFROM
in Maple 2017 using the same lib. 
OH - hell. Is the implementation of _Inert_FOR different in 2017 versus 2018?! That would be very annoying!
- this may have been the root cause all along!!

Maple 2018:
_Inert_FORFROM(
1	_Inert_LOCAL(1), 
2	_Inert_INTPOS(1), 
3	_Inert_INTPOS(1), 
4	_Inert_INTPOS(4), 
5	_Inert_NAME("true", _Inert_ATTRIBUTE(_Inert_NAME("protected", _Inert_ATTRIBUTE(_Inert_NAME("protected"))))), 
6   _Inert_STATSEQ(_Inert_FUNCTION(_Inert_ASSIGNEDNAME("print", "PROC", _Inert_ATTRIBUTE(_Inert_NAME("protected", 	
		_Inert_ATTRIBUTE(_Inert_NAME("protected"))))), _Inert_EXPSEQ(_Inert_PARAM(1)))), 
7	_Inert_NAME("false", _Inert_ATTRIBUTE(_Inert_NAME("protected", _Inert_ATTRIBUTE(_Inert_NAME("protected"))))))

Maple 2017:
_Inert_FORFROM(
1	_Inert_LOCAL(1), 
2	_Inert_INTPOS(1), 
3	_Inert_INTPOS(1), 
4	_Inert_INTPOS(4), 
5	_Inert_NAME("true", _Inert_ATTRIBUTE(_Inert_NAME("protected", _Inert_ATTRIBUTE(_Inert_NAME("protected"))))), 
6   _Inert_STATSEQ(_Inert_FUNCTION(_Inert_ASSIGNEDNAME("print", "PROC", _Inert_ATTRIBUTE(_Inert_NAME("protected", 	
		_Inert_ATTRIBUTE(_Inert_NAME("protected"))))), 
		_Inert_EXPSEQ(_Inert_PARAM(1))))
	)

YEP. That's the deal. 
Looks like I need to add a "false" as the final attribute for Maple 2018 in for loops. 
(might even be able to keep the procmake stuff....)

Hmmmm. MIght be useful to modernize anyway. Ponder.

Inert_FOR occurs in only two places (contract and parse) - so relativly centralized.
not too hard to fix. (8 places prior to ToInert refactoring). 

Ok, keep the ToInert() stuff as future proofing. 

Add check for version() > 1265877 (with a define INERT_FOR_7ARGS)
- seems to work

TODO: supress version logging, or move to the init and assign to a global
Check the KN RiemSq result - still think form might be different than before. 

Re-think

Make a wrapper for &for and see if that is all that is needed - greatly reduces the need for regression testing. 





Test Plan
=========
Unit tests for symmetric and asymmetric symmetry creation
Check some standard objects:
- definition of Chr1
- definition of Rabcd
- contraction to Ricci and Gab
- specify components of a vector
