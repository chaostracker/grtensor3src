GRTensorIII Source code, release notes and build procedure

This repo holds the source code for GRTensorIII package for Maple

For installation and usage see the Wiki tab on the GITLAB page
==============================================================================

The code has been restructured to reside in a single Maple module, grtensor.

The Module is defined in build/griii.mpl

The Makefile will run the build/griii.mpl using command line Maple provided
that the Makefile has been edited to have the correct paths. 

The use of a Module/Package in Maple required re-scoping of many of the internal
variables used in GRTensor. Briefly:
- all component info is now in gr_data[<root>, <metric>, etc.]
- spacetime dimension is in Ndim[<metric>]
- active metric is grG_metricName


If you're interested in hacking around in the source code there are
some old notes describing GRTensorII source in the file doc/grtensor.notes.

The code structure has changed into a single module, but much of the structure
of the code as described there is still relevant. 

Feature Request:
Support multicharacter index names
- key issue is tha grF_indexFind in str2def.mpl walks the characters between brckets and returns an array
  aligned place by place with the characters in the string 
  e.g. grF_indexFind( grF_stringify( `T{ a ^b}`)):
#      yeilds: [ 0,0,0,dn,0,0,up,0 ]

And so would need to refactor the callers of this routine. 
(It also currently skips spaces and would need to change this so spaces are seen as a delimiter)

Requires code in grF_str2def that just pulls index names from the string directly

HACK? Could just put in some kind of continuation character in the index find being returned
e.g. T{abc def} => [0,0,dn,c,c,0,dn,c,c] where c denotes a continuation character

Or - could return some kind of tokenized character list
"T", "{", "abc", "def", "}"
